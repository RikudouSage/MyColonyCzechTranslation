Using weapons purchased from the black market or from government fire sales, the United Earth began annexing many of the previously independent nation states of the world, eventually coming to control the majority of the planet.  The General Assembly was formed in order to give the people of the Earth the illusion democracy and with the promise to promote peace and stability on the planet, although most real power was placed into the newly created office of the President of United Earth.\n\nUnder the thumb of the United Earth President and the General Assembly, economic conditions improved somewhat, but times were still tough.

The Insectoids promptly executed all Reptilians on world, took control of the planet, and renamed it to Zolarg Prime.  Zolarg was named emperor for life of the people of Zolarg Prime, which became the new homeworld of the Insectoid race.\n\nThe Zolarg now travel the stars attempting to free their brothers from Alpha Draconian slave camps.

General Assembly and so they simply stopped sending payments.  The General Assembly attempted to compel them pay up by first slapping the planet with a trade embargo.  When that failed, a full immigration embargo and blockade of the planet were implemented.\n\nAfter months of embargo, Terra Nova still refused to give in, so the President of United Earth sent in a detachment of Space Marines to occupy the capitol and bring the city back under Earth's control.\n\nAs a result of the occupation, a Terra Nova militia commander known as Admiral Beuford P. Tots led the people of Terra Nova in a rebellion against the U.E. Space Marine force, forcing the Marines to evacuate from the planet.  The Colonial Congress of Terra Nova then sent a formal declaration of independence to the United Earth General Assembly, and the planet was renamed to Independent State.\n\nInspired by the actions on Terra Nova and disillusioned with the extreme taxation imposed by the United Earth General Assembly, neighboring systems began to follow suit and soon the League of Independent States was born, a loose alliance of planets with a common defense treaty against United Earth aggression.\n\nThe independence of the LIS member states has not been formally recognized by the United Earth General Assembly, which still considers the planets to be in rebellion.",

Nowhere has this been more keenly felt than among the Insectoid race, which has been largely reduced to a secondary slave class throughout the Alpha Draconian's growing sphere of influence.\n\nWhere they don't use their technological advantage to conquer, they use it for control and exploitation.  Many governments throughout the galaxy are under direct control of the Draconians, with 'elected' officials serving as mere puppets of the Reptilians.  On many worlds, the sectors of banking, entertainment, education, and media are all controlled by the Alpha Draconian propaganda machine.\n\nThe results of this have been both positive and negative.  The Alpha Draconian elite have become extremely rich from exploitation and slave labor, but the combination of advanced technology and free labor have left most of the population poor and destitute.  Riots and uprisings are common among Draconian colonies, and generally once a planet has been stripped of it's resources, the Alpha Draconian elite will pack up shop and leave the common citizens behind to die.\n\nAnother threat to the Alpha Draconians comes from the growing technical abilities and military tactics of the few remaining Insectoid colonies in the Zolarg Empire, which have been growing more aggressive in their resistance of the Alpha Draconians.",

En utilisant les armes ou en versant des pots de vins, la Terre Unie a commencé à annexer de nombreux États-nations autrefois indépendants, pour finalement contrôler la majorité de la planète. L’Assemblée Générale a été créée dans le but de donner à la population de la Terre l’illusion de la démocratie et la promesse de promouvoir la paix et la stabilité sur la planète, bien que le pouvoir réel ait été confié au nouveau président de la Terre Unie. \n\nSous le Président de la Terre Unie et de l'Assemblée Générale, la situation économique s'est quelque peu améliorée, mais les temps étaient encore difficiles. C’est au cours de cette période que de nombreux citoyens désillusionnés ont commencé à quitter la Terre en masse, préférant tenter leur chance sur des mondes désolés et stériles plutôt que de souffrir de la tyrannie et de la stagnation sur leur planète.

Les Insectoïdes ont rapidement exécuté tous les reptiliens, ont pris le contrôle de la planète et l'ont renommée Zolarg Prime, en l’honneur de l’empereur à la vie du nouveau peuple dela planète, qui est devenu le nouveau monde natal de la race des insectes . \n\nLes Zolarg parcourent maintenant les étoiles pour tenter de libérer leurs frères des camps d’esclaves Alpha Draconians.

L’Assemblée Générale a tenté de les contraindre à payer en commençant par un embargo sur les biens de commerce. En vain. Un embargo sur l’immigration et un blocus de la planète ont donc été mis en place. \n\nAprès des mois d’embargo, Terra Nova a toujours refusé. Pour les faire céder, le président de la Terre Unie a envoyé un détachement de Space Marines pour occuper la capitale et ramener la ville sous le contrôle de la Terre. \n\nEn réponse à cette opération, un commandant de la milice de Terra Nova, connu sous le nom de l'amiral Beuford P Tots mena les habitants de Terra Nova dans une rébellion obligeant les Marines à évacuer la planète. Le Congrès Colonial de Terra Nova envoya alors une déclaration officielle d'indépendance à l'Assemblée Générale de la Terre Unie, et la planète fut renommée État Indépendant. \n\nInspirés par les actions menées sur Terra Nova et submergés par la taxation extrême imposée par l'Assemblée Générale de la Terre Unie, les systèmes solaires voisins ont commencé à faire de même et bientôt la Ligue des États Indépendants était née, une alliance de planètes avec un traité de défense commun contre une éventuelle agression de la Terre Unie. \n\nL'indépendance des États membres de la LIS n'a pas été officiellement reconnue par l'Assemblée Générale de la Terre Unie, qui considère toujours ces planètes en rébellion.

Cet avantage a notemment été ressenti par la race Insectoïde, qui a été réduite à l’esclavage dans toute la sphère d'influence de l'empire Alpha Draconian.\n\nLorsqu'ils n'utilisent pas leur avantage technologique pour conquérir, ils l'utilisent pour le contrôle et l'exploitation. De nombreux gouvernements à travers la galaxie sont sous le contrôle direct des Draconiens, leurs représentants «élus» étant de simples marionnettes au service des Reptiliens. Les divertissements, l’éducation et les médias sont tous contrôlés par la propagande draconienne.\n\nLes réactions sont à la fois positives et négatives. L’élite draconienne est devenue extrêmement riche grâce à l’exploitation et au travail forcé, mais la combinaison de la technologie de pointe et du travail forcé a laissé la majorité de la population pauvre et démunie. Les émeutes et les soulèvements sont courants dans les colonies draconiennes et, généralement, une fois qu'une planète est privée de ses ressources, l'élite draconienne fait ses bagages et laisse les citoyens ordinaires derrière elle se débrouiller.\n\nUne autre grande menace pour les Alpha Draconians sont les capacités technologiques et militaires croissantes des dernières colonies d'insectoïdes de l'empire de Zolarg, qui se sont montrées de plus en plus agressives dans leur résistance contre l’empire.
