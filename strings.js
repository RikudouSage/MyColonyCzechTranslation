When that failed, a full immigration embargo and blockade of the planet were implemented.\n\nAfter months of embargo, Terra Nova still refused to give in, so the President of United Earth sent in a detachment of Space Marines to occupy the capitol and bring the city back under Earth's control.\n\nAs a result of the occupation, a Terra Nova militia commander known as Admiral Beuford P. Tots led the people of Terra Nova in a rebellion against the U.E. Space Marine force, forcing the Marines to evacuate from the planet.  The Colonial Congress of Terra Nova then sent a formal declaration of independence to the United Earth General Assembly, and the planet was renamed to Independent State.\n\nInspired by the actions on Terra Nova and disillusioned with the extreme taxation imposed by the United Earth General Assembly, neighboring systems began to follow suit and soon the League of Independent States was born, a loose alliance of planets with a common defense treaty against United Earth aggression.\n\nThe independence of the LIS member states has not been formally recognized by the United Earth General Assembly, which still considers the planets to be in rebellion.",
            "draconian-extended-backstory": "One of the oldest surviving civilizations in the galaxy, the Alpha Draconians consider themselves to be the heirs of the Ancients, a mysterious old civilization which once covered most of the known galaxy, the traces of which can be found buried in most habitable planets.\n\nWhile it remains unknown what happened to the Ancients, the bulk of their technology was indeed inherited by the Alpha Draconians, giving them a brutal advantage in conflicts with neighboring systems.  Nowhere has this been more keenly felt than among the Insectoid race, which has been largely reduced to a secondary slave class throughout the Alpha Draconian's growing sphere of influence.\n\nWhere they don't use their technological advantage to conquer, they use it for control and exploitation.  Many governments throughout the galaxy are under direct control of the Draconians, with 'elected' officials serving as mere puppets of the Reptilians.  On many worlds, the sectors of banking, entertainment, education, and media are all controlled by the Alpha Draconian propaganda machine.\n\nThe results of this have been both positive and negative.  The Alpha Draconian elite have become extremely rich from exploitation and slave labor, but the combination of advanced technology and free labor have left most of the population poor and destitute.  Riots and uprisings are common among Draconian colonies, and generally once a planet has been stripped of it's resources, the Alpha Draconian elite will pack up shop and leave the common citizens behind to die.\n\nAnother threat to the Alpha Draconians comes from the growing technical abilities and military tactics of the few remaining Insectoid colonies in the Zolarg Empire, which have been growing more aggressive in their resistance of the Alpha Draconians.",
            "manual-controls-intro": "My Colony offers several control methods, depending on the type and capabilities of your device, as well as your preferred style of play.  Although the game was designed with Keyboard and Mouse controls in mind, it has been adapted to support most common control setups.",
            "manual-keyboard-intro": "The optimal control scheme for My Colony is the Keyboard and Mouse/Pen combo, as the game is designed with this interface in mind first and foremost.\n\nMouse or Pen controls are fairly intuitive.  You can select units and buildings with a single click.  You can click/hold and then drag the mouse to select all units in an area.  Double clicking on a unit will select all units of that kind.  When a unit is selected, right clicking will execute an action, depending on what you right clicked on, whether it is a harvest order, a move order, or a build order.  The map is scrolled by click/dragging, or in fullscreen mode you can also simply move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen to scroll the viewport.  The mouse scroll wheel allows for zooming in and out.\n\nThe engine also supports a variety of keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized in the Engine Settings menu.  Below is a reference of the currently available keyboard bindings:",
            "manual-touch-intro": "My Colony offers a fully developed touch interface that works on any device containing a touchscreen input.  Most touch actions are similar in nature to mouse click inputs, although there are minor differences.  Zooming in and out is done with the standard pinch gesture common on touch devices, and scrolling the map is also done in a common and intuitive manner.",
            "manual-gamepad-intro": "In addition to keyboard and touch, My Colony is fully playable with a gamepad.  When using a gamepad, the UI will automatically transform to an optimized 'ten foot' interface, allowing for comfortable gameplay on a television or other large screen device.\n\nThe gamepad interface was designed around the Xbox 360/One controller layout, which has essentially become the standard gamepad layout for many PC and Android controllers.  The following controls are set with that layout in mind, although button names may differ depending on the brand and style of gamepad you are using:",
            "gen-local-mode": "Local Game",
            "manual-local-mode": "Playing a Local Game in My Colony requires no account or online connection.  In Local Mode, you will start the game as a sub colony of one of the base AI civilizations, and will be required to pay the standard tax rates until you gain independence.  The AI will offer no extra assistance to you while building up your colony.\n\nLocal games are able to play LAN/Wifi based multiplayer with other local mode players on the same network.  LAN/Wifi multiplayer is cross platform and supported on all devices except when played through the web browser (for security reasons), unless the Ape Apps Desktop Bridge (a part of the Ape Apps Launcher) has been installed and activated.  LAN players are able to send each other messages and trade resources.\n\nUnless using a custom map or playing in creative mode, a local game can be switched into online mode, although doing so will cost the colony all of its resources.\n\nWhen in local mode, the games built in anti-cheating mechanisms are half way disabled.  A colony found to have cheated will not be punished in any way while playing a local game, but the game will block that colony from ever switching into online mode.",
            "manual-online-mode": "Players with a valid Ape Apps Account and internet connection can play My Colony in Online Mode.  An online game is mostly similar to a local game, but there are several key differences.\n\nFirstly, starting a game in online mode will place your colony under the control of another players colony.  The player controlling the parent colony may choose to alter your tax rate higher or lower, or to charge no taxes at all.  Online parent colonies will also usually send their child colonies gifts of resources to help them get started.",
            "manual-online-commonwealth": "In online play, the relationship between parent and child colonies is known as a commonwealth.  Once an online colony gains independence from it's parent, it is established as the leader of a new commonwealth, and any child colony that joins under the parent's charter becomes a member state of that commonwealth.  Players may choose to join any commonwealth they wish by the use of a charter code, which can be found in the statistics screen of the parent colony.  More information about charter codes and listings of the top online commonwealths can be found on https://www.my-colony.com\n\nThe benefits of joining any given commonwealth will vary widely based on the parent colony and the player who controls it.  If you are interested in playing online and finding a good active commonwealth, you are encouraged to check out the Commonwealth section of the My Colony forums.",

Most players refer to this by the name of the United Earth building which unlocks it, the Galatic Board of Trade.\n\nWhen playing online, the current resources in the online marketplace have a large impact on each online colony, as all local prices are determined by the current global market value.  Depending on the resource production balance of any given colony, price swings on the global market can have wide ranging impacts on anything from the size and power of your economy, to the happiness (or willingness to continue working) of individual colonists.",

When playing in creative mode, all structures in the game are unlocked and can be built with no technology or resource requirements.

            "manual-single-city": "Whether you start a game in local, online, or creative mode, you are able to choose between a single city and a regional game.\n\nIn a single city game, your entire city is contained within one map and one file.  Upon starting the game, you are able to select what size of map you wish to play on, as well as the abundance of starting resources on that map.  Later on in the game as your government level increases, you are able to expand your map size by annexing new lands.  The downfall of this is that game performance degrades as the size of your map increases, particularly on slower devices.  For this reason, the Region mode was created.",
            "manual-regions": "Regional mode was added to the game due to performance issues related to ever expanding single city maps.  A region caps map sizes at either the small or medium level, and the ability to expand maps using the annexation feature has been removed.  The trade off to this limitation is the fact that a single region may contain up to 2,500 individual map files in total, theoretically allowing for massive colonies.\n\nRegions work by splitting a city up into smaller chunks, with each chuck being processed separately, yet sharing a common resource and technology pool.  This setup increases the performance of ultra large cities dramatically, and allows a city to be built in specialized chunks.  Economic and population statistics are available for both the individual cities and the region as a whole, but for online reporting purposes, the stats for the entire region are used.",

For example, if you were trying to draw out the tech tree in a structured programmatic way (for this manual, for example), it would not be possible or practical, as each new technology is dependent on technologies from not only several different branches in the tree, but also on resources which may or may not have been unlocked by the player at any given time.  Therefore, in order to be easily readable, any visual tech tree would need to be manually created and updated by hand.  Such tech trees exist on the My Colony online reference website here: https://www.my-colony.com/reference/\n\nFor the purposes of this manual, all technologies are here listed in alphabetical order for easy lookup and reference, along with a description of each, their requirements, and what they may unlock.",
